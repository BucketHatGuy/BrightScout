*About BrightScout*

Welcome to BrightScout, an intuitive scouting solution for teams gathering data on robots during competition.


*Why was BrightScout Made?*

During the 2024 FRC Season, our team struggled to gather vital data on other teams during competition when trying to use other scouting solutions we found online.
From problems with unintuitive user interfaces that just tried to look graphically nice, to members having to take multiple seconds to input data causing them to
input wrong data, to outputting data and finding it to be corrupt, we managed to find that everything that could go wrong did go wrong.

BrightScout is an intuitive scouting solution that removes all of the struggle to make sure that the scouting process is as simple and neat as possible.
With a simple user interface, a simple user interface, QR codes to transfer data from one device to another, and data that gets averaged out to get
right to the point, this app works to take all of the frusturating parts of scouting in order to allow scouting to be as simple and efficient as possible.


*How to use BrightScout*

BrightScout is optimized for Android Tablets using portrait mode, as that is what Team 5801 uses in order to gather all of its data. There is no
internet required, as data is compiled locally onto the tablet and QR codes allow for data to be transferred through devices wirelessly without
having to interfere with wireless communication with robots on the competition field. Simply download the app by downloading the apk in the release tab, and watch as BrightScout makes scouting a simple and intuitive task that lets everyone get an advantage
during the competition season.
